Little did they realize back then, they were makin' memories
Let's listen to the land we all love, nature's plan will shine above, listen to the land, listen to the land
Time falls away but these small hours, these little wonders, still remain
The battles, the stories, the losses and all the glories, we're changed by the way we live every day
There it is, Wendy, second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning
Hey, it's okay, it's okay / You're welcome, I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade / Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming / Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
They took the credit for your second symphony / Rewritten by machine and new technology
And when I haver, hey I know I'm gonna be / I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you
You're still in bed at ten / And work began at eight / You've burned your breakfast / So far, things are going great
Helter skelter in a summer swelter / The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram / On a silver-black phantom bike
You don't need money, don't take fame / Don't need no credit card to ride this train
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world / But it's feeling just like every other morning before
Sing with me, sing for the year / Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong / But where do you belong
Einstein, James Dean, Brooklyn's got a winning team / Davy Crockett, Peter Pan, Elvis Presley, Disneyland
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral / Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I feel like a lightning strike / Every time I rock the mic / You can join me if you like or I'll go on my own
The sun is a miasma / Of incandescent plasma / The sun's not simply made out of gas
And, as I recall, I think, we both kind of liked it, / And I said, "Well that's, the one thing we got."
I like smoke and lightnin' / Heavy metal thunder / Racing in the wind / And the feeling that I'm under
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed / Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
Do you believe we are all innately good / Do you think that you would love me 'til tomorrow if you could
Destination unknown, as we pull in for some gas / Freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Come on baby, make it hurt so good / Sometimes love don't feel like it should / You make it hurt so good
Like a grand and miraculous spaceship, our planet has sailed through the universe of time; and for a brief moment we have been among it’s passengers
It might be keen / To build a town of green / And a wonderful road of yellow brick!
Why don't you tell your dreams to me / Fantasy will set you free
Oh don't you dare look back / Just keep your eyes on me
In this beautiful life there's always some sorrow / And It's a double-edged knife, but there's always tomorrow
As someone told me lately / Everyone deserves the chance to fly
What can I say? / I got carried away, and not just by balloon...
I'm the architect of tick-tock tech / A frequent flier on a cosmic trek
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up / Nobody learns without gettin' it wrong
They said it was a sin and shame, and they winked at one another / And every drink in the place was full the night Pat Murphy died
What if I lost my direction? / What if I lost sense of time?
One short day in the emerald city / One short day full of so much to do
When the beating of your heart / Echoes the beating of the drums / There is a life about to start / When tomorrow comes!
Which of the Pickwick triplets did it? / Who of the crew would commit this crime?
That's what you get for falling in love / You get a little and it's never enough
It was long ago / and it was far away / and it was so much better than it is today
OK, here we go, we got a real pressure cooker going here / Two down, nobody on, no score, bottom of the ninth
I'm getting bugged driving up and down this same old strip / I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip
